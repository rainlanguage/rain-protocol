For example, the DID\n/// (Decentralized Identifiers) specification from W3C outlines that the\n/// controller and the subject of an identity are two different entities.\n///\n/// This is because self-identification is always problematic to the point of\n/// being uselessly unbelievable.\n///\n/// For example, I can simply say \"I am the queen of England\" and what\n/// onchain mechanism could possibly check, let alone stop me?\n/// The same problem exists in any situation where some priviledge or right is\n/// associated with identity. Consider passports, driver's licenses,\n/// celebrity status, age, health, accredited investor, social media account,\n/// etc. etc.\n///\n/// Typically crypto can't and doesn't want to deal with this issue. The usual\n/// scenario is that some system demands personal information, which leads to:\n///\n/// - Data breaches that put individual's safety at risk. Consider the December\n///   2020 leak from Ledger that dumped 270 000 home addresses and phone\n///   numbers, and another million emails, of hardware wallet owners on a\n///   public forum.\n/// - Discriminatory access, undermining an individual's self-sovereign right\n///   to run a full node, self-host a GUI and broadcast transactions onchain.\n///   Consider the dydx airdrop of 2021 where metadata about a user's access\n///   patterns logged on a server were used to deny access to presumed\n///   Americans over regulatory fears.\n/// - An entrenched supply chain of centralized actors from regulators, to\n///   government databases, through KYC corporations, platforms, etc. each of\n///   which holds an effective monopoly over, and ability to manipulate user's\n///   \"own\" identity.\n///\n/// These examples and others are completely antithetical to and undermine the\n/// safety of an opt-in, permissionless system based on pseudonomous actors\n/// self-signing actions into a shared space.\n///\n/// That said, one can hardly expect a permissionless pseudonomous system\n/// founded on asynchronous value transfers to succeed without at least some\n/// concept of curation and reputation.\n///\n/// Anon, will you invest YOUR money in anon's project?\n///\n/// Clearly for every defi blue chip there are 10 000 scams and nothing onchain\n/// can stop a scam, this MUST happen at the social layer.\n///\n/// Rain protocol is agnostic to how this verification happens. A government\n/// regulator is going to want a government issued ID cross-referenced against\n/// international sanctions. A fan of some social media influencer wants to\n/// see a verified account on that platform. An open source software project\n/// should show a github profile. A security token may need evidence from an\n/// accountant showing accredited investor status. There are so many ways in\n/// which BOTH sides of a fundraise may need to verify something about\n/// themselves to each other via a THIRD PARTY that Rain cannot assume much.\n///\n/// The trust model and process for Rain verification is:\n///\n/// - There are many `Verify` contracts, each represents a specific\n///   verification method with a (hopefully large) set of possible reviewers.\n/// - The verifyee compiles some evidence that can be referenced by ID in some\n///   relevant system. It could be a session ID in a KYC provider's database or\n///   a tweet from a verified account, etc. The ID is a `uint256` so should be\n///   enough to fit just about any system ID, it is large enough to fit a hash,\n///   2x UUIDs or literally any sequential ID.\n/// - The verifyee calls `add` _for themselves_ to include their ID under their\n///   account, after which they _cannot change_ their submission without\n///   appealing to someone who can remove. This costs gas, so why don't we\n///   simply ask the user to sign something and have an approver verify the\n///   signed data? Because we want to leverage both the censorship resistance\n///   and asynchronous nature of the underlying blockchain. Assuming there are\n///   N possible approvers, we want ANY 1 of those N approvers to be able to\n///   review and approve an application. If the user is forced to submit their\n///   application directly to one SPECIFIC approver we lose this property. In\n///   the gasless model the user must then rely on their specific approver both\n///   being online and not to censor the request. It's also possible that many\n///   accounts add the same ID, after all the ID will be public onchain, so it\n///   is important for approvers to verify the PAIRING between account and ID.\n/// - ANY account with the `APPROVER` role can review the added ID against the\n///   records in the system referenced by the ID. IF the ID is valid then the\n///   `approve` function should be called by the approver.\n/// - ANY account with the `BANNER` role can veto either an add OR a prior\n///   approval. In the case of a false positive, i.e. where an account was\n///   mistakenly approved, an appeal can be made to a banner to update the\n///   status. Bad accounts SHOULD BE BANNED NOT REMOVED. When an account is\n///   removed, its onchain state is once again open for the attacker to\n///   resubmit a new fraudulent session ID and potentially be reapproved.\n///   Once an account is banned, any attempt by the account holder to change\n///   their session ID, or an approver to approve will be rejected. Downstream\n///   consumers of a `State` MUST check for an existing ban.\n///   - ANY account with the `REMOVER` role can scrub the `State` from an\n///   account. Of course, this is a blockchain so the state changes are all\n///   still visible to full nodes and indexers in historical data, in both the\n///   onchain history and the event logs for each state change. This allows an\n///   account to appeal to a remover in the case of a MISTAKEN BAN or also in\n///   the case of a MISTAKEN ADD (e.g. wrong ID value), effecting a\n///   \"hard reset\" at the contract storage level.\n///\n/// Banning some account with an invalid session is NOT required. It is\n/// harmless for an added session to remain as `Status.Added` indefinitely.\n/// For as long as no approver decides to approve some invalid added session it\n/// MUST be treated as equivalent to a ban by downstream contracts.\n///\n/// Rain uses standard Open Zeppelin `AccessControl` and is agnostic to how the\n/// approver/remover/banner roles and associated admin roles are managed.\n/// Ideally the more credibly neutral qualified parties assigend to each role\n/// for each `Verify` contract the better. This improves the censorship\n/// resistance of the verification process and the responsiveness of the\n/// end-user experience.\n///\n/// Ideally the admin account assigned at deployment would renounce their admin\n/// rights after establishing a more granular and appropriate set of accounts\n/// with each specific role.\ncontract Verify is AccessControl {\n\n    /// Any state never held is UNINITIALIZED.\n    /// Note that as per default evm an unset state is 0 so always check the\n    /// `addedSince` block on a `State` before trusting an equality check on\n    /// any other block number.\n    /// (i.e. removed or never added)\n    uint32 constant public UNINITIALIZED = uint32(-1);\n\n    /// Emitted when a session ID is first associated with an account.\n    event Add(address indexed account, uint256 indexed id);\n    /// Emitted when a previously added account is approved.\n    event Approve(address indexed account);\n    /// Emitted when an added or approved account is banned.\n    event Ban(address indexed account);\n    /// Emitted when an account is scrubbed from blockchain state.\n    event Remove(address indexed account);\n\n    /// Admin role for `APPROVER`.\n    bytes32 public constant APPROVER_ADMIN = keccak256(\"APPROVER_ADMIN\");\n    /// Role for `APPROVER`.\n    bytes32 public constant APPROVER = keccak256(\"APPROVER\");\n\n    /// Admin role for `REMOVER`.\n    bytes32 public constant REMOVER_ADMIN = keccak256(\"REMOVER_ADMIN\");\n    /// Role for `REMOVER`.\n    bytes32 public constant REMOVER = keccak256(\"REMOVER\");\n\n    /// Admin role for `BANNER`.\n    bytes32 public constant BANNER_ADMIN = keccak256(\"BANNER_ADMIN\");\n    /// Role for `BANNER`.\n    bytes32 public constant BANNER = keccak256(\"BANNER\");\n\n    // Account => State\n    mapping (address => State) public states;\n\n    /// Defines RBAC logic for each role under Open Zeppelin.\n    constructor (address admin_) public {\n        _setRoleAdmin(APPROVER, APPROVER_ADMIN);\n        _setupRole(APPROVER_ADMIN, admin_);\n        _setRoleAdmin(REMOVER, REMOVER_ADMIN);\n        _setupRole(REMOVER_ADMIN, admin_);\n        _setRoleAdmin(BANNER, BANNER_ADMIN);\n        _setupRole(BANNER_ADMIN, admin_);\n\n        // This is at the end of the constructor because putting it at the\n        // start seems to break the source map from the compiler 🙈\n        require(admin_ != address(0), \"0_ACCOUNT\");\n    }\n\n    /// Typed accessor into states.\n    function state(address account_) external view returns (State memory) {\n        return states[account_];\n    }\n\n    /// Derives a single `Status` from a `State` and a reference block number.\n    function statusAtBlock(State calldata state_, uint32 blockNumber)\n        external\n        pure\n        returns (Status)\n    {\n        // The state hasn't even been added so is picking up block zero as the\n        // evm fallback value.

These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it."

This can be used to disambiguate in the case that\n there may be many possible options for a user to achieve some tier.\n For example, consider the case where `Tier.THREE` can be achieved\n by EITHER locking 1x rare NFT or 3x uncommon NFTs. A user with both\n could use `data` to explicitly state their intent.\n NOTE however that _any_ address can call `setTier` for any other\n address.\n If you implement `data` or anything that changes state then be very\n careful to avoid griefing attacks.\n The `data` parameter can also be ignored by the contract implementing\n `ITier`. For example, ERC20 tokens are fungible so only the balance\n approved by the user is relevant to a tier change.\n The `setTier` function SHOULD prevent users from reassigning\n `Tier.ZERO` to themselves.\n The `Tier.ZERO` status represents never having any status.\n @dev Updates the tier of an account.\n The implementing contract is responsible for all checks and state\n changes required to set the tier. For example, taking/refunding\n funds/NFTs etc.\n Contracts may disallow directly setting tiers, preferring to derive\n reports from other onchain data.\n In this case they should `revert(\"SET_TIER\");`.\n @param account Account to change the tier for.\n @param endTier Tier after the change.\n @param data Arbitrary input to disambiguate ownership\n (e.g. NFTs to lock)."

                "text": "@title Verify\n Trust-minimised contract to record the state of some verification process.\n When some off-chain identity is to be reified on chain there is inherently\n some multi-party, multi-faceted trust relationship. For example, the DID\n (Decentralized Identifiers) specification from W3C outlines that the\n controller and the subject of an identity are two different entities.\n This is because self-identification is always problematic to the point of\n being uselessly unbelievable.\n For example, I can simply say \"I am the queen of England\" and what\n onchain mechanism could possibly check, let alone stop me?\n The same problem exists in any situation where some priviledge or right is\n associated with identity. Consider passports, driver's licenses,\n celebrity status, age, health, accredited investor, social media account,\n etc. etc.\n Typically crypto can't and doesn't want to deal with this issue. The usual\n scenario is that some system demands personal information, which leads to:\n - Data breaches that put individual's safety at risk. Consider the December\n   2020 leak from Ledger that dumped 270 000 home addresses and phone\n   numbers, and another million emails, of hardware wallet owners on a\n   public forum.\n - Discriminatory access, undermining an individual's self-sovereign right\n   to run a full node, self-host a GUI and broadcast transactions onchain.\n   Consider the dydx airdrop of 2021 where metadata about a user's access\n   patterns logged on a server were used to deny access to presumed\n   Americans over regulatory fears.\n - An entrenched supply chain of centralized actors from regulators, to\n   government databases, through KYC corporations, platforms, etc. each of\n   which holds an effective monopoly over, and ability to manipulate user's\n   \"own\" identity.\n These examples and others are completely antithetical to and undermine the\n safety of an opt-in, permissionless system based on pseudonomous actors\n self-signing actions into a shared space.\n That said, one can hardly expect a permissionless pseudonomous system\n founded on asynchronous value transfers to succeed without at least some\n concept of curation and reputation.\n Anon, will you invest YOUR money in anon's project?\n Clearly for every defi blue chip there are 10 000 scams and nothing onchain\n can stop a scam, this MUST happen at the social layer.\n Rain protocol is agnostic to how this verification happens. A government\n regulator is going to want a government issued ID cross-referenced against\n international sanctions. A fan of some social media influencer wants to\n see a verified account on that platform. An open source software project\n should show a github profile. A security token may need evidence from an\n accountant showing accredited investor status. There are so many ways in\n which BOTH sides of a fundraise may need to verify something about\n themselves to each other via a THIRD PARTY that Rain cannot assume much.\n The trust model and process for Rain verification is:\n - There are many `Verify` contracts, each represents a specific\n   verification method with a (hopefully large) set of possible reviewers.\n - The verifyee compiles some evidence that can be referenced by ID in some\n   relevant system. It could be a session ID in a KYC provider's database or\n   a tweet from a verified account, etc. The ID is a `uint256` so should be\n   enough to fit just about any system ID, it is large enough to fit a hash,\n   2x UUIDs or literally any sequential ID.\n - The verifyee calls `add` _for themselves_ to include their ID under their\n   account, after which they _cannot change_ their submission without\n   appealing to someone who can remove. This costs gas, so why don't we\n   simply ask the user to sign something and have an approver verify the\n   signed data? Because we want to leverage both the censorship resistance\n   and asynchronous nature of the underlying blockchain. Assuming there are\n   N possible approvers, we want ANY 1 of those N approvers to be able to\n   review and approve an application. If the user is forced to submit their\n   application directly to one SPECIFIC approver we lose this property. In\n   the gasless model the user must then rely on their specific approver both\n   being online and not to censor the request. It's also possible that many\n   accounts add the same ID, after all the ID will be public onchain, so it\n   is important for approvers to verify the PAIRING between account and ID.\n - ANY account with the `APPROVER` role can review the added ID against the\n   records in the system referenced by the ID. IF the ID is valid then the\n   `approve` function should be called by the approver.\n - ANY account with the `BANNER` role can veto either an add OR a prior\n   approval. In the case of a false positive, i.e. where an account was\n   mistakenly approved, an appeal can be made to a banner to update the\n   status. Bad accounts SHOULD BE BANNED NOT REMOVED. When an account is\n   removed, its onchain state is once again open for the attacker to\n   resubmit a new fraudulent session ID and potentially be reapproved.\n   Once an account is banned, any attempt by the account holder to change\n   their session ID, or an approver to approve will be rejected. Downstream\n   consumers of a `State` MUST check for an existing ban.\n   - ANY account with the `REMOVER` role can scrub the `State` from an\n   account. Of course, this is a blockchain so the state changes are all\n   still visible to full nodes and indexers in historical data, in both the\n   onchain history and the event logs for each state change. This allows an\n   account to appeal to a remover in the case of a MISTAKEN BAN or also in\n   the case of a MISTAKEN ADD (e.g. wrong ID value), effecting a\n   \"hard reset\" at the contract storage level.\n Banning some account with an invalid session is NOT required. It is\n harmless for an added session to remain as `Status.Added` indefinitely.\n For as long as no approver decides to approve some invalid added session it\n MUST be treated as equivalent to a ban by downstream contracts.\n Rain uses standard Open Zeppelin `AccessControl` and is agnostic to how the\n approver/remover/banner roles and associated admin roles are managed.\n Ideally the more credibly neutral qualified parties assigend to each role\n for each `Verify` contract the better. This improves the censorship\n resistance of the verification process and the responsiveness of the\n end-user experience.\n Ideally the admin account assigned at deployment would renounce their admin\n rights after establishing a more granular and appropriate set of accounts\n with each specific role."
